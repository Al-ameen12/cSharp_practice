# Student Grade Calculator

## Project Overview

I built a simple C# console application that calculates and reports student grades based on assignment scores.

## Features
- I used **arrays** to store student names and scores.
- I processed scores with **nested `foreach` loops** and **`if` statements**.
- I calculated **average scores** and assigned **letter grades**.
- I handled **extra credit** for additional assignments.

## What I Learned
- How to declare and use arrays in C#.
- How to use `foreach` loops to iterate through data.
- How to apply `if` statements for decision-making.
- How to calculate averages and assign letter grades.
- How to structure a simple console application in C#.

## Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET Console Application
